_Research pseudo classes, found this extremely interesting. It opens up so much more customization with small quality-of-life changes. Focusing on the small things like having a link change color when hovered over, or changing color of a link or text area if the keyboard is focused on it. Also includes powerful tools for selecting very specific things, like child elements such as a list. You can specifically target things like the first listing from a list, and this allows you to target multiple specific things instead of creating a unique div or targeting all of a list. There's a ton more, and I'm definitely going to be coming back to this page for whenever I need some CSS done on my work._
